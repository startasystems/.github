## üçø Github: An unstoppable community

We decided to build Starta Systems on GitHub. In fact, we've been doing this since **mid-2016**. But unfortunately we still can't dedicate ourselves full time to this dream. That's why we imagine that the development of our projects is a little slow at the beginning, since we have our own formal jobs in big techs companies. But what motivates us is this possibility to work on our own projects, inspired and sponsored by our community to develop unique softwares!

That's why we believe that an open source community is fundamental to building our software today. Our team is small and distributed throughout Brazil at the moment, [but we are always open to welcome new members](../CONTRIBUTING_PT-BR.md).
